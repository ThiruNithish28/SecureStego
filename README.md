# SecureStego
  SecureStego is my one of the best projects i had done and its my favoutre website which i made. One day me and my bois are dicuss about steganography, Which is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video, or audio content. That hidden data is then extracted at its destination. 
  For steganography there are so many tools are there for both windows and linux like Steghide,Binwalk,stegSolve but these tools are need to install and execute where as some tools provide a online services also but that are not too user- freindly. So for i decide to make a secure and well user friendly Website which is easy to use and simple. Thats the arrival of [SecureStego](https://thirunithish28.github.io/SecureStego/).

## Features
  - Simple and Secure.
  - No login required.
  - User Friendly
  - hiden message in the image.
  - Decode the message also.
    
## Future ideas
  - Where in securestego is implementing only for image files, but in future user can able to hide message in audio file also.
  - Right now SecureStego implementing LSB algortihm which is old and simple algorithm to encode and decode the message over the bits of image file. In future, enhance more secure by using strong algortihms

## Tech Stack

  - css (Bootstrap)
  - Js
  - LSB algorithm
